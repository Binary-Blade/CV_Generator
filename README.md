# React Resume Generator

## Overview

This project is a simple yet functional Resume Generator built using React and Tailwind CSS to practice React Basic Concept. The primary focus of this application is to demonstrate the use of React's `useState` hook to manage state within the application. The project provides an interactive way to input personal, professional, and educational information which is then dynamically displayed as a preview of a resume.

## Technologies

- **React**: Utilized for building the user interface. React's functional components and hooks are central to the project's structure.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Employed for styling the components and layouts. Tailwind's utility-first approach allows for rapid UI development with custom styling.
- **useState Hook**: The core React hook used in this project. It's used for managing the state of each form and the preview display.

## Features

- **Form Input Components**: Separate forms for personal, professional, and educational information.
- **Dynamic Preview**: As users input their information in the forms, a live preview of their resume is updated.
- **Modular Design**: The application is divided into reusable components, making the codebase clean and maintainable.

## Limitations

- **Preview Customization**: Currently, the CV preview section lacks detailed customization options. It displays the information in a basic format.
- **State Management**: The project is designed to demonstrate the use of `useState` hook, hence advanced state management patterns or tools like Redux or Context API are not implemented.
